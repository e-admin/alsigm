/**
 *  Abstract from IETF Specification:
 *  <p>
 *  This specification defines the format of UUIDs (Universally Unique
 *  IDentifier), also known as GUIDs (Globally Unique IDentifier). A UUID
 *  is 128 bits long, and if generated according to the one of the
 *  mechanisms in this document, is either guaranteed to be different
 *  from all other UUIDs/GUIDs generated until 3400 A.D. or extremely
 *  likely to be different (depending on the mechanism chosen). UUIDs
 *  were originally used in the Network Computing System (NCS) [1] and
 *  later in the Open Software Foundation's (OSF) Distributed Computing
 *  Environment [2].

     * can be just incremented; otherwise it should be set to a random or
     * high-quality pseudo random value.
     * <p>
     * Similarly, if the node ID changes (e.g. because a network card has
     * been moved between machines), setting the clock sequence to a random
     * number minimizes the probability of a duplicate due to slight
     * differences in the clock settings of the machines. (If the value of
     * clock sequence associated with the changed node ID were known, then
     * the clock sequence could just be incremented, but that is unlikely.)
     * <p>
     * The clock sequence MUST be originally (i.e., once in the lifetime of
     * a system) initialized to a random number to minimize the correlation
     * across systems. This provides maximum protection against node
     * identifiers that may move or switch from system to system rapidly.
     * The initial value MUST NOT be correlated to the node identifier.

      * If a system does not have a primitive to generate cryptographic
      * quality random numbers, then in most systems there are usually a
      * fairly large number of sources of randomness available from which one
      * can be generated. Such sources are system specific, but often
      * include:
      * 
      * - the percent of memory in use
      * - the size of main memory in bytes
      * - the amount of free main memory in bytes
      * - the size of the paging or swap file in bytes
      * - free bytes of paging or swap file
      * - the total size of user virtual address space in bytes
      * - the total available user address space bytes
      * - the size of boot disk drive in bytes
      * - the free disk space on boot drive in bytes
      * - the current time
      * - the amount of time since the system booted
      * - the individual sizes of files in various system directories
      * - the creation, last read, and modification times of files in various
      *   system directories
      * - the utilization factors of various system resources (heap, etc.)
      * - current mouse cursor position
      * - current caret position
      * - current number of running processes, threads
      * - handles or IDs of the desktop window and the active window
      * - the value of stack pointer of the caller
      * - the process and thread ID of caller
      * - various processor architecture specific performance counters
      *   (instructions executed, cache misses, TLB misses)
      * 
      * (Note that it precisely the above kinds of sources of randomness that
      * are used to seed cryptographic quality random number generators on
      * systems without special hardware for their construction.)
      * 
      * In addition, items such as the computer's name and the name of the
      * operating system, while not strictly speaking random, will help
      * differentiate the results from those obtained by other systems.
      * 
      * The exact algorithm to generate a node ID using these data is system
      * specific, because both the data available and the functions to obtain
      * them are often very system specific. However, assuming that one can
      * concatenate all the values from the randomness sources into a buffer,
      * and that a cryptographic hash function such as MD5 [3] is available,
      * then any 6 bytes of the MD5 hash of the buffer, with the multicast
      * bit (the high bit of the first byte) set will be an appropriately
      * random node ID.
